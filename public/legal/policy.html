    <h2 class="mt-5 text-center">INFORMATION: WHAT WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED</h2>
    When a web site visitor or customer expresses interest in obtaining additional information about Polaris Share's
    services or registers to use a Polaris Share service, Polaris Share may require the party to provide contact
    information, such as name, and email address.
    <br>
    Polaris Share's permission-based services are designed to facilitate repeat use by participants involved in multiple
    business transactions relying upon the services. Key to the security of these services and the business data
    contained therein, veriﬁcation of user’s virtual identity is fundamental to using this service. Participants must
    provide proﬁle information (name, email address) in order to utilize and secure the services.
    <br>
    In addition to the proﬁle information collected as described above, Polaris Share also collects anonymous
    information about the use of our public web site, including but not limited to a visitor's IP address, the websites
    from which visitors access the Polaris Share web site, the type of web browsers used to access the website, the time
    of the visit, and the pages viewed. This collected information does not personally identify individuals and is
    required to operate the service, for security, to fulﬁll certain legal requirements and statistical analysis of web
    site visits.
    <br><br>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Cookies</h3>
    In order to collect the anonymous data described above, or to provide a better user experience for repeat users of
    our permission-based services, we may use "cookies" that remain in the cookies ﬁle of your browser at your option.

    In the provision of our permission-based services, Polaris Share will maintain a history of participant access to
