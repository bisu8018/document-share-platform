            In order to collect the anonymous data described above, or to provide a better user experience for repeat

            <div className="font-weight-bold mt-5 mb-2">Data Controllers/Processors</div>
            Polaris Share provides services to customers who use these services to in turn support their own individual
            business
            functions. These Polaris Share owners / administrators create users for these services are considered data
            controllers for certain types of user data related to their respective vaults. Polaris Share is thus the
            processor
            for that data. Polaris Share customers (owners / administrators) share the responsibility for this category
            of data
            and are provided the tools to fulfill that obligation for their users who are eligible for the additional
            GDPR
            privacy rights.
            <br/>
            Polaris Share customers share personal information with Polaris Share to establish and maintain services,
            and for
            this information Polaris Share is the Controller and is bound contractually as part of the contract for
            services.
            <br/>
            Affiliated third party providers who in turn support the Polaris Share service also share responsibility as
            Processors
            and Sub-Processors in a similar manner.
            <br/>
            All parties with support roles or access to applicable personal information within Polaris Share, are
            appropriately
            bound by contract to be compliant with the GDPR principles.

            Share. Owners / administrators can request help from Polaris Share for complying with GDPR compliance,
            including
